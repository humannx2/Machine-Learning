# SVM-Based Diabetes Prediction Model

## Overview
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict diabetes using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. 
The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which includes various medical predictor variables. The project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook for clarity and reproducibility, achieving a test accuracy of 80%.

## Dataset
The Pima Indians Diabetes Database is used to train the model. This dataset contains several medical features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels, which are essential for predicting the onset of diabetes. 
The dataset used for training and testing can be found under the dataset folder.
